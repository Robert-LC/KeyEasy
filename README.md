# Motivation ðŸ«¡

I wanted to learn scales on piano, but I couldn't always play because I was in a house with 3 roomates. Either they were sleeping, or making lots of noise...
and learning scales can be boring its hard to visualize their shape and patterns, so I decided to make KeyEasy.
A ReactJS app that has you click the scale in the right order, offering visual feedback that is easier to understand than in real life.
