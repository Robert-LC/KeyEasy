# KeyEasy
Key Easy is an Interactive Piano meant to teach the User musical scales.



This is my 1st React App from scratch, and it also has a C# Web API backend
that will be implemented in the future for storing/retrieving high scores and custom game modes.

_For now the game is only in demo mode where the user is only quizzed on C Major and C# Major_

Feel free to try it here
